                        Hello, I'm Luise, a 26-year-old software developer from Berlin, Germany, now based in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. <br/>
                        I currently work as a Junior Developer at Omni Calculator, where I develop scientific calculators and lead the German content team.<br/>
                        A major project was creating seven financial calculators, boosting user engagement in Germany by 7% monthly. I also build web applications, 
                        handling tasks like secure payment gateways, APIs integration, and dynamic content management.<br/>
                        To enhance my skills, I'm pursuing a B.Sc. in Software Engineering at IU International University of Applied Sciences.<br/>
                        My technical expertise includes JavaScript, React, Git, SQL, and various frameworks. A notable project was developing a 
                        web app for a surf school which streamlined the school's lesson scheduling. I am committed to writing secure, best-practice code and continuously learning 
                         through courses on Java, web development, and design patterns.<br/>
                         Outside work, I enjoy surfing in Brazil and spending time with my horse.</p>
